# Repository operating context

Before changing scientific or DGX execution code, read these files in order:

1. `docs/CURRENT_SCIENTIFIC_PROTOCOL.md`
2. `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
3. `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`
4. `docs/NEXT_ACTION.md`
5. `docs/DGX_BATCH_RUNBOOK.md` when Slurm or DGX work is involved
6. `docs/PROTOCOL_DEVIATIONS.md` and `docs/SERIALIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` for detailed contracts

Treat `docs/NEXT_ACTION.md` as the current handoff, but verify it against Git and job sentinels.
Never infer scientific success from file existence or a partial notebook. Require scheduler state,
exit status, an atomic COMPLETE sentinel, semantic validators, and recorded hashes.

Do not open raw EHRSHOT rows or patient-level artifacts for code assistance. Never print or commit
subject identifiers, prediction timestamps, serialized histories, labels, predictions, embeddings,
or private manifest rows. Governed work stays on MedNet/DGX; off-VPN work uses source code,
synthetic fixtures, and reviewed aggregate reports only. Do not access held-out test performance
until the protocol and test gate are explicitly frozen.

Do not silently lock the proposed panel, rerun an expensive job, run a model, or overwrite a job
sentinel. Preserve source notebooks and write executed copies only under `outputs/private/`.

Current critical state: DGX job 407 computed Notebook 03 and the aggregate alignment report at
source commit `f9a370c7fe1cb13edd126128cfddc79100852913`, then failed because the host-side validator
lacked `nbformat`. Do not rerun Notebook 03. The next action is the evidence-bound recovery in
`scripts/slurm/11b_recover_phase1_alignment.sbatch`; DEV-013 remains unresolved until that recovery
job produces a verified COMPLETE sentinel.
